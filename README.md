fyroah's hdwgh practice map remade [v1 map link](https://www.mediafire.com/file/r94d6zxspfi5fpm/HDWGH_Practice.zip/file)

how to get the map? go to the [releases tab](https://github.com/acewhite1010/hdwgh-practice-v2-1.16.1/releases), and download it. voila!

## map v2.3.1 15/5/2022
  fifth release of the remade map.
  - features:
    - replaced outdated design by odogster and replaced with t_wagz's latest setup design "ChaCha"
    - added options for 12-bottle (9-bottle brewing) and 27-bottle (9-bottle x3) for brewing simulation
    - tweaked item count for the full simulation practice.
  - fixes:
    - should fix the attempt counter problem. if the problem still exists, probably it's a video card issue. previous version link [here](https://workupload.com/file/dddkBMS92C6)
    - minimalist's setup is previously scuffed; now it's cleaner and stick more to fyroah's original demo video.
    - i need feedback on the 27-bottle brewing simulation, as i have never done 27 bottles. are the ingredients given correctly? what's too much and what can be better? (also i might make separate inventories for both setups)

## map v2.2.1 05/12/2021
  fourth release of the remade map.
  - fixes:
    - fire spreading in map is turned off
    - fixed beacon on/off toggling. now the preset edit space's beacon won't effect the practice space's beacon.

## map v2.2 05/12/2021
  third release of the remade map.
  - features:
    - changed and made the shulker boxes more obvious.
    - fixed quidvio's and odogster's preset.
    - for full practices, preset items are now fit into a shulker box in the practice site.
    - added a note: the reason a water bucket is included, is because of a bug relating to structure saving. remember when you see a flooded taiga fisherman's house? that's what i'm talking about: [waterlogged blocks spread](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-127644).
    - bad omen, hero of the village and mining fatigue are all now toggled from clicking chat.
    - added an item-toggled resetting system, although clicking through chat is still possible. clicking the thing in chat with blindness is difficult, i know.
  - people are having issues opening the map with carpet mod; and i have no idea how to fix it. just a sidenote.

## map v2.1 02/12/2021
  second release of the remade map.
  - features:
    - fixed a me-being-dumb bug for putting the v1 map inside the zip file. sorry friends.
    - fixed a bug on: resetting in the end preset (aka mathbook's preset) does not kill items
    - fixed a bug on: waterlogged blocks remain waterlogged in the overworld presets
    - found a bug on: lighting problems in the overworld preset practices. i'm working on a way to solve it. (chuck some suggestion in if you have some :D )
    - added credits. thanks for fyroah for making the v1 map, and quidvio for pinging me about problems at 1am in the night xD
  - a lil side note: i'm learning how to use github. if i'm dumb, apologies. (kek actually send help)

## map v2 01/12/2021
  initial release of the remade map.
  - features:
    - added 6 prebuild practices: Quidvio's setup / Odogster's setup / T_Wagz' setup / my setup (lol) / Minimalist's setup (demo by Fyroah) / Mathbook's End Setup
    - preset demo videos links [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyRH4ToGDU5k3TPYSou6vcuz3443eGBJ-)
    - added a customizable setup, default is a modified version of the minimalist's setup (psp put the boat on the wither rose)
    - added a full-on practice mode, simulates a real run practice. yes without armor because why will you need them
    - added a toggle for HHH mode
    - added an attempt count for successful attempts (in preset practices and full practices)
    - remade the brewing simulator mode
  - ideas to add in the (maybe) next update:
    - more beacon-swap friendly presets (???)
