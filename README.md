## map v2.1 02/12/2021
  second release of the remade map.
  - features:
    - fixed a me-being-dumb bug for putting the v1 map inside the zip file. sorry friends.
    - fixed a bug on: resetting in the end preset does not kill items
    - fixed a bug on: waterlogged blocks remain waterlogged in the overworld presets
    - found a bug on: lighting problems in the overworld preset practices. i'm working on a way to solve it. (chuck some suggestion in if you have some :D )
    - added credits. thanks for fyroah for making the v1 map, and quidvio for pinging me about problems at 1am in the night xD

## map v2 01/12/2021
  initial release of the remade map.
  - features:
    - added 6 prebuild practices: Quidvio's setup / Odogster's setup / T_Wagz' setup / my setup (lol) / Minimalist's setup (demo by Fyroah) / Mathbook's End Setup
    - preset demo videos links [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyRH4ToGDU5k3TPYSou6vcuz3443eGBJ-)
    - added a customizable setup, default is a modified version of the minimalist's setup (psp put the boat on the wither rose)
    - added a full-on practice mode, simulates a real run practice. yes without armor because why will you need them
    - added a toggle for HHH mode
    - added an attempt count for successful attempts (in preset practices and full practices)
    - remade the brewing simulator mode
  - ideas to add in the (maybe) next update:
    - more beacon-swap friendly presets (???)
