## map v2.5 11/12/2022
  ==REPO LINK CHANGED, HERE'S THE [LATEST](https://github.com/acewhite1010/hdwgh-practice-v2)==
  
  eighth release(s) of the remade map.
  - additions:
    - an icon for the map
    - 1.19 version of the map
  - minor fixes:
    - custom setup issue fix is more intuitive and 1^10n % less scuffed.
    - chacha setup: shulker boat is back to original position, hence a water bucket is by default, inserted in the inventory box. (preventing bullets, and avoiding 1.19 problems)
    - minor tweaks to custom setups' terrain.
    - armor is now automatically applied to the player when playing both practice modes.
    - cleaned up some code and functions.
  - the 1.19 map:
    - full practice lets you customize where you'll be "spawning" the warden. In real runs, you're expected to transport the warden through the portal; hence recommended to simulate it by building a portal frame, and then spawning the warden in it. [Demonstration from Elysaku's 1.19 AA Run](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1520805535/?t=06h11m30s)
    - mathbook's end setup is removed, as end HDWGH is probably not as doable as in pre1.19 versions. all the other setups are tweaked and adapts to the edition of the warden in the setup.
- planning: a 1.12 version map, beacon speedbuilding mode.

## map v2.4 23/6/2022
  seventh release of the remade map.
  - minor fixes:
    - chacha's setup player hole is now one block deeper as it should. thanks rowl
    - notorious custom setup issue reason: it's an [issue](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-105595) relating to security.
    - for custom setups, current patch is very scuffed but still works. if you want a better one specifically for this, the v1 map works.

## map v2.3.2 17/5/2022
  sixth release of the remade map.
  - minor fixes:
    - minimalist's setup is tweaked better, but the beacon doesn't give the effects. now it's patched and will work as normal.

## map v2.3.1 15/5/2022
  fifth release of the remade map.
  - features:
    - replaced outdated design by odogster and replaced with t_wagz's latest setup design "ChaCha"
    - added options for 12-bottle (9-bottle brewing) and 27-bottle (9-bottle x3) for brewing simulation
    - tweaked item count for the full simulation practice.
  - fixes:
    - should fix the attempt counter problem. if the problem still exists, probably it's a video card issue. previous version link [here](https://workupload.com/file/dddkBMS92C6)
    - minimalist's setup is previously scuffed; now it's cleaner and stick more to fyroah's original demo video.
    - i need feedback on the 27-bottle brewing simulation, as i have never done 27 bottles. are the ingredients given correctly? what's too much and what can be better? (also i might make separate inventories for both setups)

## map v2.2.1 05/12/2021
  fourth release of the remade map.
  - fixes:
    - fire spreading in map is turned off
    - fixed beacon on/off toggling. now the preset edit space's beacon won't effect the practice space's beacon.

## map v2.2 05/12/2021
  third release of the remade map.
  - features:
    - changed and made the shulker boxes more obvious.
    - fixed quidvio's and odogster's preset.
    - for full practices, preset items are now fit into a shulker box in the practice site.
    - added a note: the reason a water bucket is included, is because of a bug relating to structure saving. remember when you see a flooded taiga fisherman's house? that's what i'm talking about: [waterlogged blocks spread](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-127644).
    - bad omen, hero of the village and mining fatigue are all now toggled from clicking chat.
    - added an item-toggled resetting system, although clicking through chat is still possible. clicking the thing in chat with blindness is difficult, i know.
  - people are having issues opening the map with carpet mod; and i have no idea how to fix it. just a sidenote.

## map v2.1 02/12/2021
  second release of the remade map.
  - features:
    - fixed a me-being-dumb bug for putting the v1 map inside the zip file. sorry friends.
    - fixed a bug on: resetting in the end preset (aka mathbook's preset) does not kill items
    - fixed a bug on: waterlogged blocks remain waterlogged in the overworld presets
    - found a bug on: lighting problems in the overworld preset practices. i'm working on a way to solve it. (chuck some suggestion in if you have some :D )
    - added credits. thanks for fyroah for making the v1 map, and quidvio for pinging me about problems at 1am in the night xD
  - a lil side note: i'm learning how to use github. if i'm dumb, apologies. (kek actually send help)

## map v2 01/12/2021
  initial release of the remade map.
  - features:
    - added 6 prebuild practices: Quidvio's setup / Odogster's setup / T_Wagz' setup / my setup (lol) / Minimalist's setup (demo by Fyroah) / Mathbook's End Setup
    - preset demo videos links [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyRH4ToGDU5k3TPYSou6vcuz3443eGBJ-)
    - added a customizable setup, default is a modified version of the minimalist's setup (psp put the boat on the wither rose)
    - added a full-on practice mode, simulates a real run practice. yes without armor because why will you need them
    - added a toggle for HHH mode
    - added an attempt count for successful attempts (in preset practices and full practices)
    - remade the brewing simulator mode
  - ideas to add in the (maybe) next update:
    - more beacon-swap friendly presets (???)
